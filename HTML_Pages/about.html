                The Story of Gary Blue's Diner Gary Blue's Diner is a renowned casual dining
                restaurant that started in the historic district of downtown St. John's, NL.
                Gary's grandfather, "Big Red", moved from Ireland in the 1850's looking for a
                better life for him and his family. Big Red's mother was a cook for an Irish
                landowner, so he spent a lot of time in the kitchen. At the young age of 10,
                Red was already working full time with his mama; cutting up vegetables,
                washing dishes but his favorite job was being his Mama's taste tester. His
                Mama cooked with meats, vegetables and spices he had never tasted before. At
                the passing of his beloved mother, he took his little family across the ocean
                looking for a better and brighter life for his family. With little to no
                education or job experience, Red started working in the back of restaurants
                washing the dishes. But he had ambition and worked his way up and down Water
                Street at the various establishments learning the restaurant trade.

                Red and his wife, Dolly, scrimped and saved every penny they had in the hopes
                of one day opening their own little place. Forty years later, at the age of
                55, Red and his family had saved enough money to open a little eat-in dinner
                called "Big R's" after Red himself. Unfortunately, Big Red only lived his
                dream for 10 years. Red's oldest son, Rick learned to cook from his father but
                he credit's his mother, Dolly, for teaching him to be hardworking, have dreams
                and most importantly, no matter how good the food is - customer service made
                or broke a restaurant. Rick turned Big R's into one of St.John's famous
                take-out.
              </p>

                Unlike his father and grandfather before him, Gary spent his days in school
                but any spare time he had; he was at the restaurant. Gary followed in his
                family footsteps and opened his own restaurant "Gary Blue's Diner". The
                restaurant is a family-owned and operated full-service restaurant. Gary's
                philosophy centers around each customer individually. He wants their meal to
                be something they remember long after the last bite. Focusing on fresh local
                ingredients and attention to deal have contributed the success and continual
                growth of the restaurant. As Gary's family grows so does his business with the
                opening of his new location in CBS which is run by his youngest daughter,
                Regina named after her great grandmother.
